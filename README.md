## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm run install:all
    ```

2. Build the VSIX file:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3. Install the extension:
    - Option 1: Drag and drop the `.vsix` file into VSCode's Extensions panel
    - Option 2: Use the CLI:
        ```bash
        code --install-extension bin/clinetastic-1.0.0.vsix
        ```

## Usage Tips

- Use `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` and type "Clinetastic: Open In New Tab" for side-by-side view
- Leverage @-mentions for efficient context addition:
    - `@url`: Add web documentation
    - `@problems`: Include workspace diagnostics
    - `@file`: Add specific file contents
    - `@folder`: Include entire directory contents

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether it's bug fixes, feature additions, or documentation improvements, your help makes Clinetastic better.

### Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
